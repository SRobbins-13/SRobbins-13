### Howdy! Welcome to my projects page. Here's a quick introduction to me :bowtie:

- :bulb: I'm interested in applying data science to the pressing issues facing the world today, be it climate change, green energy technologies, politics, economic inequality, etc. and finding innovative solutions to those problems. 
- :computer: I'm a recent graduate of the Metis Data Science and Engineering bootcamp
- :earth_africa: I'm a former researcher with a Master's degree in Geology and an Undergraduate degree in Geosystems Engineering, both from UT Austin – hook 'em! :metal:
- :books: In my free time I enjoy hiking, cooking, playing chess, and reading (free book rec: *Gentleman in Moscow* with a Clos St Michel Chateauneuf-Du-Pape wine pairing :wine_glass:).
- :v:My pronouns are he/him
